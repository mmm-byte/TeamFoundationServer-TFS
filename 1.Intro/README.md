# What is TFS Azure Devops?
TFS stands for Team Foundation Server, which is a Microsoft product that provides source code management (SCM), project management, and team collaboration features. It is commonly used by software development teams to manage 
their source code, track work items, manage builds, and facilitate collaboration among team members. TFS offers features such as version control (using Microsoft's proprietary version control system called Team Foundation 
Version Control or TFVC), work item tracking, automated builds, release management, and integration with other development tools. TFS is often used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Studio, a popular integrated development
environment (IDE), to provide a comprehensive solution for software development and application lifecycle management.


# Introduction to Team Foundation Server (TFS)
Team Foundation Server (TFS) was a Microsoft product that provided a suite of tools and services for software development and application lifecycle management. It offered features to help development teams manage source code, track work items, automate builds, perform testing, manage releases, and facilitate collaboration among team members. TFS aimed to improve the overall efficiency, quality, and coordination of software development projects. TFS included several key components and functionalities:     

1. Version Control: TFS supported two primary version control systems: Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) and Git. These systems allowed teams to manage and track changes to their source code over time, enabling collaboration while maintaining code integrity.
2. Work Item Tracking: TFS allowed teams to define, track, and manage various work items, such as tasks, bugs, features, and user stories. This feature facilitated project planning, task allocation, and progress tracking.
3. Build and Release Management: TFS provided tools for creating and automating build and release pipelines. This allowed teams to build, test, and deploy their applications consistently and reliably.
4. Agile Planning: TFS supported agile methodologies by offering features like scrum and Kanban boards, sprint planning, backlog management, and capacity planning. These features helped teams organize their work and manage project priorities effectively.
5. Testing: TFS included capabilities for both manual and automated testing. Testers could define and execute test plans, record test results, and integrate testing into the development process.
6. Reporting and Analytics: TFS offered reporting and analytics features that allowed teams to track progress, measure performance, and make data-driven decisions about their projects.
7. Integration with Development Tools: TFS seamlessly integrated with development tools like Microsoft Visual Studio, enabling developers to work within a familiar environment.

Microsoft has transitioned from TFS to Azure DevOps Services, a cloud-based platform that provides similar capabilities with improved scalability, flexibility, and integration with other cloud services. Azure DevOps Services covers a broader range of services beyond what TFS offered. While TFS itself may not be actively developed or promoted by Microsoft anymore, the concepts and practices associated with it are still relevant in the context of modern software development processes.


 ## Benefits
* Streamlined Development: TFS helped streamline software development processes by providing tools for version control, continuous integration, automated testing, and release management. This led to faster and more reliable software delivery.
* Improved Collaboration: TFS fostered collaboration among development teams, testers, and other stakeholders by providing a centralized platform for communication, code sharing, and work item tracking.
* Enhanced Visibility: TFS offered real-time visibility into project progress, work item status, and code changes. This visibility enabled better decision-making and helped teams stay on track.
* Quality Assurance: TFS's testing capabilities allowed teams to ensure software quality through automated testing, manual testing, and tracking of test results. This contributed to the production of higher-quality software.
* Agile and DevOps Practices: TFS supported agile methodologies and DevOps practices, helping teams embrace iterative development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery for improved efficiency and responsiveness.
* Scalability and Flexibility: TFS could scale to accommodate projects of varying sizes and complexities. Its extensibility allowed teams to adapt the platform to their unique requirements.
* Centralized Knowledge: TFS served as a repository of project-related information, code, and documentation, making it easier for new team members to onboard and contribute effectively.
* Integrated Development Environment: TFS seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio and other development tools, providing a cohesive environment for developers to work in.

# TFS Vs Azure DevOps Service
Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services are both Microsoft offerings designed to enhance software development and application lifecycle management. While TFS operates as an on-premises solution, requiring installation and maintenance within an organization's infrastructure, Azure DevOps Services takes a cloud-based approach, offering a managed service hosted in the Azure cloud. In terms of features, both platforms provide version control, work item tracking, build and release automation, and collaboration tools. Azure DevOps Services, however, extends its capabilities with integrated Azure services, such as Azure Pipelines, Boards, Repos, and Artifacts, providing an expansive ecosystem for streamlined development. With TFS, customization is attainable through process template modifications and extensions, while Azure DevOps Services offers automatic updates, eliminating the need for manual upgrades. Azure DevOps Services' scalability is easily adaptable, dynamically provisioning resources as needed, while TFS scalability depends on your organization's infrastructure and resource management. The choice between TFS and Azure DevOps Services hinges on factors such as control, cloud integration, managed services, and scalability preferences.
