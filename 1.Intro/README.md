# What is TFS?
TFS stands for Team Foundation Server, which is a Microsoft product that provides source code management (SCM), project management, and team collaboration features. It is commonly used by software development teams to manage 
their source code, track work items, manage builds, and facilitate collaboration among team members. TFS offers features such as version control (using Microsoft's proprietary version control system called Team Foundation 
Version Control or TFVC), work item tracking, automated builds, release management, and integration with other development tools. TFS is often used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Studio, a popular integrated development
environment (IDE), to provide a comprehensive solution for software development and application lifecycle management.
